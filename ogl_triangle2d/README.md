# OpenGL Triangle (Clean CMake Project)

This project is a **simple OpenGL application** that renders a **single triangle** using **OpenGL 3.3 Core Profile**.  
It is intentionally kept minimal to demonstrate a **clean C++ project structure** using **CMake**, while still showing the full fundamental OpenGL rendering pipeline.

The goal of this project is to provide a **clear and correct baseline** for OpenGL development with:
- proper folder separation (`include/` and `src/`)
- a reusable internal library (`core`)
- a small application layer (`app`)
- a clean and readable `CMakeLists.txt`

---

## What This Program Does

When you run the program:
- A window is created using **GLFW**
- An OpenGL 3.3 context is initialized
- OpenGL functions are loaded using **GLEW**
- A vertex shader and fragment shader are compiled and linked
- A triangle is rendered using **VAO + VBO**
- The program runs in a render loop until the window is closed or **ESC** is pressed

The output is a window displaying a **colored triangle at the center of the screen**.

### Folder responsibilities

- **include/**  
  Public interfaces (headers only).  
  This defines what each module exposes.

- **src/**  
  Implementation files (`.cpp`).  
  Contains all OpenGL logic and application behavior.

- **core/**  
  Internal reusable library:
  - window creation
  - OpenGL context setup
  - logging

- **app/**  
  Application-specific logic:
  - shader setup
  - vertex buffer setup
  - render loop

- **build/**  
  Build output directory (generated by CMake).
